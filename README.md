# What is it
It is a small Crash 2 romhack that allows you to play at various player speeds and scales in several modes, including:
- custom (control speed and scale any time, separately)
- random each level or warp room
- random each fruit
- random each crate
- random each item
- randomly changing periodically/aperiodically
- random each spin

**It is based on pal crash 2 and you need to have the Crash 2 pal rom already, what's being released is just a patch.**

# How to use
You can apply it using a program called DeltaPatcher (https://github.com/marco-calautti/DeltaPatcher/releases).
The original file is the European (PAL) release of Crash 2 (.bin). 
If you want to make sure you are using the same original file, you can do it using certutil (Win11).
